\[ **Space Fold** \] _AKA - Mobile Gallery - first place._
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/03202355f2c029eb6f1f1d8a560fb3a95f1f887b.png)

The **_Space Fold _****__**project was a competition developed by AKA(a design forum of people) Its intent was to sponsor various competitions and curate art showings throughout the year to be display at the First Fridays Artwalk in Richmond, Virginia. Not having a venue for display, they proposed a competition to design a "**mobile gallery**".

The general requirements of the structure were: modular and able to display artwork up to 6' tall and 3' wide, freestanding, protect artwork from rain and snow, mobile.

The site will be the public sidewalk on West Broad Street, Richmond, Virginia.

These constrains made us to look onto different mobile structure systems and the art of origami was the only one to allows for a beautiful simple structure that can be folded and unfolded with ease.
